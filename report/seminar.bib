                  is an application profile of the Extensible Markup
                  Language (XML) that enables the near-real-time
                  exchange of structured yet extensible data between
                  any two or more network entities. This document
                  defines XMPP's core protocol methods: setup and
                  teardown of XML streams, channel encryption,
                  authentication, error handling, and communication
                  primitives for messaging, network availability
                  ("presence"), and request-response
